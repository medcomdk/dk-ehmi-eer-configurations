# EER Endpoint Register (EER) - Configurations

This purpose of this IG is to supply the metadatainformation needed for EER to especially merge Organization and Endpoint ressources created from SOR with EHMI Organization and Endpoint metadata in order to support the eDelivery part of EHMI.

It will among  other things handle public keys related to CVRs that are specific to the production pilot of EHMI in sept-nov 2026 (EHMI PP26).

At the moment the following ressources for EHMI PP26 are made:

- [Devices (EUA'er, MSH'er og AP'er)](instances-devices.html) 
- [Organizations](instances-organizations.html)
- [Endpoints](instances-endpoints.html)

Yet, still no proper connection between the resources, but coming up soon.
